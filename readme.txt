This is a painless way to integrate and automatically send WordPress data to Google Sheets.  

== Description ==

This plugin currently supports connecting the Contact Form 7 plugin to Google Sheets, but let us know what other kinds of data you'd like this to capture!

The <a href="http://neversettle.it/connect-wordpress-google-sheets-pro">PRO Version</a> is now available, and provides connections between unlimited CF7 forms and Google Spreadsheets! 

= How to Use this Plugin =

(Take a look at the screenshot to see how it all ties together and what settings need to go where!)

1. Install the Contact Form 7 (CF7) plugin if you haven't already. 
1. Create the CF7 Form that you want to use to capture data. You will need the ID and field names from the form.
1. Log in to your Google Account and create a new Sheet and give it a simple name. 
1. Rename Sheet 1 (tab 1 of the spreadhseet) to something simple that makes sense (maybe the name of your form).
1. Add a column name in Row 1 for "date" and each form field you will have in your form (default CF7 form field names are "your-name", "your-email", "your-subject", "your-message"). 
1. Install this plugin.
1. Edit the plugin settings and copy / paste the name of your spreadsheet and worksheet into the settings under Settings > NS Sheets.
1. Add the ID of the form you want to use in the settings.
1. Save your settings.
1. Test your form submit and verify that the data shows up in your Google Sheet.
1. Have a beer and celebrate! 

= Important Notes = 

* You must pay very careful attention to your naming. This plugin will have unpredictable results if names and spellings do not match between your Google Sheets and plugin / form settings.
* Feedback is really important to us. Let us know if there are other creative ways you want to use this.  

Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin supported? =
We'll try to answer any questions that come up in the support forum here on WP.org, but can't promise support. 

= Why isn't the data sending? CF7 Submit is just Spinning. = 

Sometimes it can take a while of spinning before it goes through. But if the entries never show up in your Sheet then one of these things might be the reason:

1. Wrong username / password for google account (not likely - I'm sure you thought of this and made sure, but just thought I'd mention)
1. Wrong Sheet filename or tab name
1. Wrong Column name mapping
1. You might have to tweak your security settings in your google account here: https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?pli=1 (This plugin uses an older Google API which requires the setting for allowing less secure apps to be Enabled)

Please double-check those things and hopefully one of them is the cause.
